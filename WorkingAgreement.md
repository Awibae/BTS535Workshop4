### Coding practices to be adopted
Standards:
  - Use camel case for variable and function names.
  - All programming should have proper documentation.
  - Follow the established company coding style guide.


Version Control
  - All new features should be created in a new branch and merged via pull requests to main once approved by the leader of the featureâ€™s development team.
  - A clear branch naming convention should be established to help the team identify the purpose and scope of each newly created branch.


Testing:
  - Unit tests must be written for the main branch to ensure all features remain functional.
  - All tests must pass successfully before any code changes are committed.


### How to update datasets and scripts repository
All code should be reviewed before launch:
  - Create separate branches for individual work, open a PR for review, merge when approved by all necessary team members.
Data validation:
  - Ensure that proper validation processes are in place to maintain data integrity.
Project backups:
  - Create regular backups each time major updates are made to prevent data loss in case any issues arise.  

### What to do when a member misses a meeting
Accountability:
  - Team members must have a valid reason for missing a meeting.
  - Team members who miss meetings should proactively communicate with the rest of the team and find alternative ways to stay engaged or delegate responsibilities to ensure that project progress is not hindered.
Multiple Absences: 
  - If a team member is frequently missing team meetings, a meeting will be held with the team to decide if they will move forward with the absentee or if they will be let go.
